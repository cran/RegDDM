Description: Drift-Diffusion Model (DDM) has been widely used to model binary
    decision-making tasks, and many research studies the relationship between
    DDM parameters and other characteristics of the subject. This package uses
    'RStan' to perform generalized liner regression analysis over DDM parameters
    via a single Bayesian Hierarchical model. Compared to estimating DDM
    parameters followed by a separate regression model, 'RegDDM' reduces bias
    and improves statistical power.
