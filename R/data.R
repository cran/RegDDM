#' Simulated dataset from from Cognitive Reserve Study.
#' @description
#' The Cognitive Reserve study is an ongoing longitudinal study to identify
#' neural implementations of cognitive reserve. Due to data sharing agreement,
#' the original dataset cannot be uploaded. This is a synthetic dataset from the
#' study. The dataset consists of two data frames. `data1` is the subject-level
#' dataset which includes the id, NART-iq, age, gender, race and education of the
#' subjects. `data2` is the trial-level data frame with the subject id, memory load,
#' response (correct = 1) and reaction time (in seconds) of the subject.
